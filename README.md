Credit Card Default Prediction (ANN)

This project predicts whether a customer will default on their credit card payment using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

A Logistic Regression model is used as a baseline, and performance is evaluated using ROC-AUC, which is suitable for imbalanced financial data.

The model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app that takes customer inputs, applies the same preprocessing (feature scaling), and outputs a default probability and risk level.
